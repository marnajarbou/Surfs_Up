# Surfs_Up
Analyze and display climatic data using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build a surf shop.

### Overview
To support my concept, I required some actual investors. I then created a business strategy and contacted W. Avy, who is well-known for his board surfing. The first meeting went off without a hitch. He was worried about the weather, though. W.Avy had invested in a shake store in his early career, but because he neglected to get a weather analysis, his endeavor failed. W. Avy is aware that I've been studying data analysis. Therefore, he has requested that some analytics be performed on a weather dataset he has from the Island where I intend to open the business.

W. Avy approves with our findings, but before launching the surf shop, he needs further details on temperature trends. He specifically requests Oahu temperature information for the months of June and December to assess if the surf and ice cream store industry can survive year-round.

### Results
Hawaii has just two seasons: Summer (Kau), which lasts from May to October, and Winter (Hooilo), which lasts from November to April. At sea level, the average daytime temperature during the summer is 85° F, while the average daytime temperature during the winter is 78° F.

Waikiki, Honolulu, and the southwest coast at Ko Olina typically receive a lot of Hawaiian sunshine, as does the southern portion of Oahu.

- According to the data below, June's average temperature is about 75° F. Minimum and maximum temperatures are 64 and 85 degrees, respectively.
- Around 71° F is the average temperature for December. Minimum temperature is 56° F and maximum temperature is 83° F.

### Summary
Although it will never be possible to anticipate the weather with absolute accuracy, Hawaiian weather analysis can be useful. Additionally, the weather appears to be almost ideal for opening a Shake business. But it's wise to conduct a few additional analyses before making the important choice.
- Determining the likelihood of a storm, hurricane, or cyclone by analyzing weather trends.
- Checking the high and low tides by looking over the surf forecast. This will enable us to assess how suitable the ocean will be all year round for surfing.
